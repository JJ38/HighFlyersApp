- (URGENT!) Reorder stops when an order is removed from a run due to it being updated by staff labelling. 
  URGENT! as the run wil not start if first stop is missing and will likely crash mid run if N+1 doesnt exist. *Will only show missing stops in order if forgotten to recalculate*

- Storing runs in offline mode to help with bad signal

- Mark stuff as cancelled in staff labelling form

- Find bug in updating order from run labelling form thats causing the update request to be sent twice

- make form submittable through stop overview list

- store all iterations of forms

- add prices to label runs form. Put in delivery box if delivery payment and in collection box if a collection payment


Release notes


- Added start times to driver app
- Fixed estimated run time showing as unknown
- Changed mode in which navigation is launched in apps. Its now set to navigation rather than marker. This means on opening an app it will immediately calculate the route. Please let me know if this is bothersome
  I can add a setting where you can choose a preference. This is a potential fix for android auto.
