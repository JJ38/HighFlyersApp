- (low priority) Reorder stops when an order is removed from a run due to it being updated by staff labelling. 
  Low priority as the run should be recalculated anyway. Will only show missing stops in order if forgotten to recalculate

- Order staff labels screen by stopnumber not ID

- Long lasting sign in

- Storing runs in offline mode to help with bad signal

- Mark stuff as cancelled in from staff labelling form

- Find bug in updating order from run labelling form thats causing the update request to be sent twice
