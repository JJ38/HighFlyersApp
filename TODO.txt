- (URGENT!) Reorder stops when an order is removed from a run due to it being updated by staff labelling. 
  URGENT! as the run wil not start if first stop is missing and will likely crash mid run if N+1 doesnt exist. *Will only show missing stops in order if forgotten to recalculate*

- Long lasting sign in

- Storing runs in offline mode to help with bad signal

- Mark stuff as cancelled in staff labelling form

- Find bug in updating order from run labelling form thats causing the update request to be sent twice

- Make sure address info wraps and doesnt go off screen on stop screen

- change label runs or orders icons as they are both currently the same
