todo:

-make sure that a driver is only assigned a run if it is optimised. Maybe store optimised route in the assignedRuns in driver doc.
-when assigning run add is progressed field to know if a driver has started run or not
-When navigation back to the your runs page. Make sure the driver docs are refetched as the status of a run might have changed

-update flash/startup screen to bird logo

-When start run is clicked show first run

-create view that shows preview of stop that allows drivers to navigate to stop.
-screen should show button that says "arrived"
-when "arrived" is clicked a form should show up asking for basic information like did they collection payment, Did they pick up the correct quantity etc.
-form should show button saying "submit" or "complete". This will release the next stop.
