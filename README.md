todo:

-add feedback to the skip order and eventually submit order sliders as the screen updates to quickly and is confusing
-update marker on map when skipping a stop

-make sure that a driver is only assigned a run if it is optimised. Maybe store optimised route in the assignedRuns in driver doc.

-update flash/startup screen to bird logo

-when "arrived" is clicked a form should show up asking for basic information like did they collection payment, Did they pick up the correct quantity etc.
-form should show button saying "submit" or "complete". This will release the next stop.
